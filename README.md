# Robot-Guidance

You are a helpful security bot. You've successfully driven the aliens off your ship. 
Unfortunately, your crew was exposed to psychoactive alien spores, and is now running around randomly, terried.
You need to help guide them to the teleport pad, so they can be teleported away and get medical care.

For running the No bot scenario, run the Simulation.py file using python
            the bot scenario, run the ExpectedTimeWithBot.py file
            for learned bot with CNN model, run Train_Bot_Overfit_CNN.py file
            for learned bot with FC Flat ship model, run Train_Bot_Overfit_FC_Flat_Ship.py
            for generalized bot, run Train_Generalized_CNN_Bot.py file
            for testing the generalized bot with random ship simulation run Main.py

Make sure to give the correct paths for saving/loading the model checkpoints.
